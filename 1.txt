Two households, both alike in dignity111111,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene11111,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny22222,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean2222.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
