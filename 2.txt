Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
I strike quickly, being moved.
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar2.
I strike quickly, being moved3.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
